			My name is Abed Islam and I am a CIT major at IUPUI with a concentration in Web Development. The picture above is of my favorite soccer player. This is Lionel Messi and I think he is the greatest soccer player to ever exist. In this image he is showing off his 6 Balon Dor trophies which is only given to the best of the best every year. It is a really hard trophy to win and he has done it 6 times which is the most number of Balon Dors any soccer player has ever gotten.
